# QuantumInformation package
This package contains numerous numerical methods for various quantum information and computation problems. The explanation of each of the numerical methods are explained in detail in the following book, ***"An Object Oriented Python Cookbook for Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing"***. The book contains more than 100 numerical routines in python and it will be extremely useful for a practising physicist, both theoretical and experimentl, working in the areas of quantum information theory, quantum computing, quantum entanglement and also on condensed matter quantum many-body spin half chains. We also remark here that, there is a chapter devoted to numerical linear algebra procedures and a final chapter on random states and matrices too. We can safely and humbly say that, the computational libraries cover a wide spectrum of topics. You can easily buy the book by clicking [here](https://www.routledge.com/An-Object-Oriented-Python-Cookbook-in-Quantum-Information-Theory-and-Quantum/Ramkarthik-Barkataki/p/book/9781032256078)
